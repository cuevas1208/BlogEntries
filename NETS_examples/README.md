# Overview

This repo contains code for the "TensorFlow for poets 2" series of codelabs.

There are multiple versions of this codelab depending on which version 
of the tensorflow libraries you plan on using:

* For [TensorFlow Lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/mobile/tflite/) the new, ground up rewrite targeted at mobile devices
  use [this version of the codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-for-poets-2-tflite) 
* For the more mature [TensorFlow Mobile](https://www.tensorflow.org/mobile/mobile_intro) use 
  [this version of the codealab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-for-poets-2).


This repo contains simplified and trimmed down version of tensorflow's example image classification apps.

* The TensorFlow Lite version, in `android/tflite`, comes from [tensorflow/contrib/lite/](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/contrib/lite).
* The Tensorflow Mobile version, in `android/tfmobile`, comes from [tensorflow/examples/android/](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/examples/android).

The `scripts` directory contains helpers for the codelab. Some of these come from the main TensorFlow repository, and are included here so you can use them without also downloading the main TensorFlow repo (they are not part of the TensorFlow `pip` installation).

Download repo:
git clone https://github.com/googlecodelabs/tensorflow-for-poets-2

Download the photos:
curl http://download.tensorflow.org/example_images/flower_photos.tgz \
    | tar xz -C tf_files

Input image resolution: 128,160,192, or 224px. Unsurprisingly, feeding in a higher resolution image takes more processing time, but results in better classification accuracy. We recommend 224 as an initial setting.

By default it would train inception V3 model. If you would like to run MobileNet you would have to specified arguments  when running retrain:
python -m scripts.retrain IMAGE_SIZE=224 ARCHITECTURE="mobilenet_0.50_${IMAGE_SIZE}"

For more options when running this script:
python -m scripts.retrain -h

Example on how to run:
python -m scripts.retrain \
  --bottleneck_dir=tf_files/bottlenecks \
  --how_many_training_steps=500 \
  --model_dir=tf_files/models/ \
  --summaries_dir=tf_files/training_summaries/"${ARCHITECTURE}" \
  --output_graph=tf_files/retrained_graph.pb \
  --output_labels=tf_files/retrained_labels.txt \
  --architecture="${ARCHITECTURE}" \
  --image_dir=tf_files/flower_photos
